#' @return A list with two elements: \code{selection}, a vector of indices of the selected features in the selection order, and \code{score}, a vector of corresponding feature scores.
#' Names of both vectors will correspond to the names of features in \code{X}.
#' Both vectors will either have a length \code{k} or zero, when all features turn out to have zero mutual information with the decision.
