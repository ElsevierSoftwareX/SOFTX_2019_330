Praznik is an R package containing a collection of information-based, feature selection filter methods.
It provides efficient implementations of several information-based filter methods, including CMIM, DISR, JMI, JMIM and mRMR, as well as corresponding feature scorers allowing for experiments.

You can install from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=praznik), or directly from GitLab with:

```r
devtools::install_gitlab('mbq/praznik')
```

Praznik is inspired by the [FEAST library](https://github.com/Craigacp/FEAST); in fact, the earlier instance of `mbq/praznik` was an R wrapper of this software. 
This project is still available as [feast_r](https://github.com/mbq/feast_r), but is no longer maintained.
