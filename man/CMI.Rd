\title{Greedy conditional mutual information maximisation filter}
\usage{
CMI(X, Y, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Attribute table, given as a data frame with either factors (preferred), booleans, integers (treated as categorical) or reals (which undergo magical cutting).
\code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{Y}{Decision attribute; should be given as a factor, but other options are accepted, exactly like for attributes.
\code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{k}{Number of attributes to select.
Must not exceed \code{ncol(X)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{selection}, a vector of names of the selected features in the selection order (note that it may be shorter than \code{k}), and \code{scores}, a vector of feature scores.
}
\description{
In each round, the method selects attribute of a maximal conditional mutual information with the decision given all the previously selected attributes. 
It stops either when \code{k} attributes have been selected or when the said criterion reaches zero, whatever comes first.
Hence, it may return some attributes but less then \code{k}.
}
\note{
In theory, most other methods in praznik are approximations of this method -- they often work better, though, as in practice conditional mutual information is hardly estimable.

The method requires input to be discrete to use empirical estimators of distribution, and, consequently, information gain or entropy.
To allow smoother user experience, praznik automatically coerces non-factor vectors in \code{X} and \code{Y}, which requires additional time and space and may yield confusing results -- the best practice is to convert data to factors prior to feeding them in this function.
Real attributes are cut into about 10 equally-spaced bins, following the heuristic often used in literature.
Precise number of cuts depends on the number of objects; namely, it is \eqn{n/3}, but never less than 2 and never more than 10.
Integers (which technically are also numeric) are treated as categorical variables (for compatibility with similar software), so in a very different way -- one should be aware that an actually numeric attribute which happens to be an integer could be coerced into a \eqn{n}-level categorical, which would have a perfect mutual information score and would likely become a very disruptive false positive.
