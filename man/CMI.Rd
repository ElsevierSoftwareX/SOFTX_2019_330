\title{Greedy conditional mutual information maximisation filter}
\usage{
CMI(X, Y, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Attribute table, given as a data frame with only factor columns. \code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{Y}{Decision attribute; must be a factor. \code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{k}{Number of attributes to select. Must not exceed \code{ncol(X)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{selection}, a vector of names of the selected features in the selection order (note that it may be shorter than \code{k}), and \code{scores}, a vector of feature scores.
}
\description{
In each round, the method selects attribute of a maximal conditional mutual information with the decision given all the previously selected attributes. 
It stops either when \code{k} attributes have been selected or when the said criterion reaches zero, whatever comes first.
Hence, it may return some attributes but less then \code{k}.
}
\note{
In theory, most other methods in praznik are approximations of this method -- they often work better, though, as in practice conditional mutual information is hardly estimable.
