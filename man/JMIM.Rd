\title{Minimal joint mutual information maximisation filter}
\usage{
JMIM(X, Y, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Attribute table, given as a data frame with either factors (preferred), booleans, integers (treated as categorical) or reals (which undergo automatic categorisation; see below for details).
\code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{Y}{Decision attribute; should be given as a factor, but other options are accepted, exactly like for attributes.
\code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{k}{Number of attributes to select.
Must not exceed \code{ncol(X)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{selection}, a vector of indices of the selected features in the selection order, and \code{score}, a vector of corresponding feature scores.
Names of both vectors will correspond to the names of features in \code{X}.
Both vectors will be at most of a length \code{k}, as the selection will stop as soon as all the remaining features will have a score of zero.
This may happen during initial selection, in which case both vectors will be empty.
}
\description{
The method starts with an attribute of a maximal mutual information with the decision \eqn{Y}.
Then, it greedily adds attribute \eqn{X} with a maximal value of the following criterion:
\deqn{J(X)=\min_{W\in S} I(X,W;Y),}
where \eqn{S} is the set of already selected attributes.
}
\note{
\code{\link{NJMIM}} is a normalised version of JMIM; \code{\link{JMI}} and \code{\link{DISR}} are modifications of JMIM and NJMIM in which a sum of joint information over already selected attributes is used instead of a minimum.

The method requires input to be discrete to use empirical estimators of distribution, and, consequently, information gain or entropy.
To allow smoother user experience, praznik automatically coerces non-factor vectors in \code{X} and \code{Y}, which requires additional time and space and may yield confusing results -- the best practice is to convert data to factors prior to feeding them in this function.
Real attributes are cut into about 10 equally-spaced bins, following the heuristic often used in literature.
Precise number of cuts depends on the number of objects; namely, it is \eqn{n/3}, but never less than 2 and never more than 10.
Integers (which technically are also numeric) are treated as categorical variables (for compatibility with similar software), so in a very different way -- one should be aware that an actually numeric attribute which happens to be an integer could be coerced into a \eqn{n}-level categorical, which would have a perfect mutual information score and would likely become a very disruptive false positive.
