\title{Mutual information maximisation filter}
\usage{
MIM(X, Y, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Attribute table, given as a data frame with only factor columns. \code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{Y}{Decision attribute; must be a factor. \code{NA}s are not allowed.}

\item{k}{Number of attributes to select. Must not exceed \code{ncol(X)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{selection}, a vector of names of the selected features in the selection order (note that it may be shorter than \code{k}), and \code{scores}, a vector of feature scores.
}
\description{
Calculates mutual information between all attributes and the decision, then returns top k.
